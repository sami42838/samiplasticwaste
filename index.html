          <h2>PLastic Waste Management</h2>
          
          <p>
            In 2020, the world produced 367 million metric tons of plastic waste, a number that is set to exponentially increase in the coming years. While reducing the generation of plastic waste in the first place is essential, efforts to manage and dispose of the existing waste is crucial to address the plastic crisis. This page is part of our Plastics and the Environment series, a set of online resources on the plastics crisis, its impact on people and the environment, and international cooperation to address this global problem. They include resources and news from organizations in Geneva and beyond, including UN-system organizations and other IOs, governmental authorities, civil society organizations, academic institutions and journals, and renowned newspapers.
          </p>
            <br />Efforts to manage plastic waste continue to evolve as the issue gains more attention and urgency on a global scale. Collaboration among governments, industries, communities, and individuals is essential to effectively address this challenge.

        <h2>Environmentally Sound Management of Plastic Waste</h2>
        <p>While avoiding the generation of plastic waste is overall preferable, environmentally sound management of plastic waste, once it is generated, is essential to protect human health and the environment. Without proper collection and disposal system, plastic contaminate the air, soil and water, thus causing harm to ecosystems and people. Since the adoption of the plastic waste amendments, the Baseic Convention provides guidance for better management of plastic waste.</p>

        <h2>Plastic Waste Trade</h2>
        <p>As the amount of plastic waste generated has exponentially increased, so has the global trade of plastic waste. In 2018, about 8 million metric tonnes of plastic waste were traded internationally, amounting for around 3.3 billion USD. With lower energy and labour costs, countries in the Global South are often on the receiving end of such trade. However, an estimates 5 to 20% of imported scraps in these countries have no market value and ends up in landfills or incinerated, leading to air, soil and water pollution. Even when recycled, it is often done so in low-cost facilities with poor conditions, posing risks to workers’ and local communities’ health and to the environment. Since January 2021, the Basel Convention regulates global plastic waste trade with the entry into force of the Plastic Amendments.</p>

        <h3>Recycling</h3>
        <p>Since the 1950s, an estimated 9% of all plastic produced by humanity has been recycled. While there has been an increased interest in and development of plastic recycling systems and facilities, still only 14% of plastic waste is currently being collected for recycling. As plastic disposal in landfill and burning has damaging consequences on human and environmental health, recycling is increasing seen as having huge potential to tackle the plastic crisis. However, plastic recycling presents many challenges due to the nature of the material itself. Meanwhile, relying on recycling alone is not sufficient to solve the plastic crisis and address the full impacts of plastics across the value chain.
    
            ‘Offsetting’ is another practice associated with plastic recycling and that represents a false hope in tackling plastic pollution. The practice of collecting plastics already present in the environment, ‘legacy plastics’, cannot pay off for the production of virgin plastics because these usually accumulate levels of toxicity that renders them unrecyclable and do not compensate the damage caused by newly produced materials.</p>

        <h4>Plastic waste and its management strategies for environmental sustainability</h4>
        <p>The massive consumption of a wide range plastic products has generated a huge amount of plastic waste. There is a need to provide awareness of their uses and routine management as a part of our lifestyle. Nowadays, plastics are increasingly being used in our daily life activities, including the packaging in different food and brewing companies, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and other production sectors need to pack their end products for efficient and safer product's delivery to the community. Plastics are produced through the biochemical process of polymerization or polycondensation. The post-use of generated plastic waste has many adverse impacts on the environment if not processed and managed in a proper way. This review aims to discuss the lifecycle of plastic products according to their different categories, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC–U), polystyrene or styrofoam (PS), polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), and others. Herein, we have also discussed the problems caused by the inadequate processing of plastic waste and the possible solutions that can be provided to ensure a good atmosphere and to reduce the causes of cli
